## Project Domain
Our project domain focuses on public transportation. We are developing a transit tracking application specific to the GO Transit network that  allows commuters to find and receive data, so they can make well-informed decisions.

## The application
Our team plans to develop a GUI-based application that allows users to retrieve and visualize train and bus service information, with planned features including <a href="https://github.com/JasonBarahan/csc207-project/issues/4">predicted departures</a> from a stop, <a href="https://github.com/JasonBarahan/csc207-project/issues/2">visualizations</a> of current train positioning, and <a href="https://github.com/JasonBarahan/csc207-project/issues/3">service updates</a>. User-sought information will be organized in a single-pane dashboard. Frequently sought data by a single user can be <a href="https://github.com/JasonBarahan/csc207-project/issues/5">saved</a>, minimizing the time needed for users to retrieve information.

This involves retrieving input data from users, organizing it into and retrieving data from API calls, displaying and visualizing data, and writing data (for frequently searched routes on a per-device basis).

More features can be found <a href="https://github.com/JasonBarahan/csc207-project/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement">here</a>.

## API
The API we are using is provided by <a href="http://api.openmetrolinx.com/OpenDataAPI/Help/Index/en">GO Transit</a>.

## Footnotes
<ul>
    <li> Our primary focus is on train services. We will focus on bus services to the extent that they substitute train services - one example is Barrie Line service being operated by buses outside of rush hour. Bus services not associated with train lines will not be included (yet).</li>
    <li> This application is not endorsed by Metrolinx or any transit agency under the purview of Metrolinx.
